SciGrapher.js is a JavaScript/TypeScript library capable of producing high quality scientific oriented graphs on the browser with minimum configuration. It's based on the HTML canvas element to ensure high responsively and avoid overload the DOM with potentially hundreds of elements.

#### What do I mean with "scientific oriented"?

SciGrapher.js, unlike other tools like Chart.js or D3.js, is not a general purpose charting library, its goal is to accurately represent numeric data generated by mathematical equations or other (physical) sources. The resulting graphs are closer to those generated by MATLAB or Matplotlib, rather than an illustrative panel, for example.

At the moment, the library offers four chart types, including:

- Line chart, this can be used to generate dispersion graphs as well.
- Area, used to represent the area between two curves.
- Heatmap, to represent scalar fields.
- Vector field, to represent two-dimensional vector fields.

## Usage

Each graph is controlled by a single object created by calling the `graph2D` function.

    graph2D(element)
    graph2D(element, options)

Where
* `element` is a div element.
* `options` is an object containing the [options](#graph-options) to change the default behavior and appearance of the graph.

> Note: The options object has a lot of properties and complex structure, its use is intended for copying or generate graphs from another graphs. All its properties are breake down in the `graph2D` methods, is best to use those instead.

To start, call the `graph2D` function and assign the object generated to a variable, use its methods to change the appearance and behavior to your needs and finally call the `draw` method to render the final result.
The methods can be chained.

HTML:

    <body>
       <div id="my-graph"></div>
    </body>

JS:

    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");
    const graph = graph2D(element).axisPoition("center").draw();

Result:

![default_graph](/assets/images/default_graph.jpg)

Almost every method is overcharged, so you can set or get the properties, for example calling `graph.axisType()` will return the current axis type used in the graph, and calling `graph.axisType("polar")` will set the graph axis type to polar and return a reference to the same graph object, so more methods can be chained.

Additionally, almost every method accepts a callback function as a second parameter. This callback will be executed right after the graph properties are updated, but before is render to the screen.

The callback function can accept one optional parameter that represents the graph object from which the method is call upon.

> Note: The execution of the optional callback function is unique to that method call, so in order to execute that function more than ones it needs to be passed to the method on each call.

___

To add data to the graph, you need to call the `addDataset` method specifying the type of the data you intend to create, the return value can be stored in a variable to later use.

    addDataset(datatype)
    addDataset(datatype, options) 

Where:

* `datatype` is one of the data types available : "linechart", "area", "heatmap" or "vectorfield".
* `options` is an object containing the [options](#linechart-options)  to change the default behavior and appearance of the dataset.

> Note. The options object has a lot of properties and complex structure, its use is intended for copying or generate datasets from another datasets. All its properties are breake down in the corresponding dataset methods, is best to use those instead.

The resulting dataset is bound to the graph, so in order to show render the result, you must call the `draw` method of the graph after the dataset creation or any modification made to it.

Example:

    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");
    const graph = graph2D(element)
		      .axisDomain({
		          x : {start : -8, end : 8},
			  y : {start : -1.2, end : 1.2}
		       })
		      .containerSize({width : 800, height : 300});
    
    const data = graph.addDataset("linechart")
		      .dataX(linspace(-8, 8, 100))
		      .dataY((dataset)=>{
		          return dataset.dataX().map(x=>Math.cos(x));
		       });

    graph.draw();

Result:

![cosine_example](/assets/images/cosine_example.jpeg)

The details on how to manipulate the datasets will be discussed in its [corresponding](#datasets) section.

### Dynamic

This method lets you set or get the dynamic properties of each axis.

This method only is relevant if the axis `position` is set to `center`.
In this position, the axis text is located below the `x` axis and at the left of the `y` axis, and the two axis intersects at the coordinate `(0,0)`.

When that coordinate is no longer inside the graph area, the axis shift to remain visible and the text change positions relative to the axis base.

Those two are the behaviors that this method can change.

For example, in the next illustration, the axis shift when the `start` value of the `y` axis domain is bigger than zero.

![axis_dynamic](/assets/gifts/axis_dynamic.gif)

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

*Method:*

    * `contained`: a boolean that determines whether the `x` axis shifts to remain visible.
  * `y`: and object with the following properties:
    * `dynamic`: a boolean that determines whether the `y` axis text changes position relative to the base.
    * `contained`: a boolean that determines whether the `y` axis shifts to remain visible.

*Returns:*

* An object representing the current properties of the axis dynamics if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon.

*Dafault values:*

    {
      x : {
        dynamic : true,
        contained : true
      },
      y : {
        dynamic : true,

### Overlap

This method lets you set or get the overlap properties of each axis.

This method only is relevant if the axis `position` is set to `center`.
In this position, the axis text may overlap with each other or with the axis itself.

To enhance visibility, a little area around each text is clear, so neither the base nor ticks will render on top of the text.

This method lets you modify that behavior.

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

### Secondary Enable:

This method lets you enable the secondary set of axis.

Each graph have the capability of defining two sets of axis, the primary `x` and `y` axis are always defined while the secondary `x` and `y` can be defined independently.

The properties of the secondary axis can be manipulated in the same way the primaries can, but the axis must be defined first and the axis `position` must *NOT* be `center`.

Each dataset can decide what pair of axis use.

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

> Note: `center` positioned axis cannot have secondary axis defined.

*Method:*

    secondaryAxisEnable()
    secondaryAxisEnable(options)
    secondaryAxisEnable(options, callback)

*Returns:*

* An object representing the current properties of the secondary axis enable if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Why the `end` value of the `y` axis is at the top and not the bottom? :
> Because of the convention of having the vertical axis values increase from bottom to top, this is a convention to follow for other similar properties.

> On that note, it is not necessary to have the `start` value be smaller than the `end` value. In that case, the axis "direction" will be reverted.

> Note: To change any secondary axis property, the corresponding axis must be enabled first.

> Warning: If any of the axis is not defined yet, the correspondign property will return the value `undefined`.

## Grid

The graph can define the use of grids to improve the data reading. There are two types of grids:

* `Primary`: The primary grid runs along the axis ticks.
* `Secondary`: The secondary grid runs in between the axis ticks.

Each grid have an `x` and `y` component, and runs perpendicular to its corresponding axis.

For example, the `x` component of the `primary` grid is composed of parallel vertical lines extending the `x` axis ticks.

> Note: If the axis type is set to `polar` the grid behavior changes.

In the case that the axis position is set to `polar`, then the behavior of the grids are as follows:

* `Primary`: 
  * The `x` component of the primary grid is composed of concentric circles around the origin with radii equal to each tick in the `x` direction.

* `Secondary`: 
  * The `x` component of the secondary grid is composed of concentric circles arround the origin with raii equal to values in between the ticks in the `x` direction.
  * The `y` component of the secondary grid is composed of rays coming out of the origin, with equal angle variation in between each ray of the `y` component of the primary grid.
