SciGrapher.js is a JavaScript/TypeScript library capable of producing high quality scientific oriented graphs on the browser with minimum configuration. It's based on the HTML canvas element to ensure high responsively and avoid overload the DOM with potentially hundreds of elements.

#### What do I mean with "scientific oriented"?

SciGrapher.js, unlike other tools like Chart.js or D3.js, is not a general purpose charting library, its goal is to accurately represent numeric data generated by mathematical equations or other (physical) sources. The resulting graphs are closer to those generated by MATLAB or Matplotlib, rather than an illustrative panel, for example.

At the moment, the library offers four chart types, including:

- Line chart, this can be used to generate dispersion graphs as well.
- Area, used to represent the area between two curves.
- Heatmap, to represent scalar fields.
- Vector field, to represent two-dimensional vector fields.

## Installation

Not available yet. Some minor bugs are being patch.

## Usage

Each graph is controlled by a single object created by calling the `graph2D` function.

    graph2D(element)
    graph2D(element, options)

Where
* `element` is a div element.
* `options` is an object containing the [options](#graph-options) to change the default behavior and appearance of the graph.

> Note: The options object has a lot of properties and complex structure, its use is intended for copying or generate graphs from another graphs. All its properties are breake down in the `graph2D` methods, is best to use those instead.

To start, call the `graph2D` function and assign the object generated to a variable, use its methods to change the appearance and behavior to your needs and finally call the `draw` method to render the final result.
The methods can be chained.

HTML:

    <body>
       <div id="my-graph"></div>
    </body>

JS:

    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");
    const graph = graph2D(element).axisPoition("center").draw();

Result:

![default_graph](/assets/images/default_graph.jpg)

Almost every method is overcharged, so you can set or get the properties, for example calling `graph.axisType()` will return the current axis type used in the graph, and calling `graph.axisType("polar")` will set the graph axis type to polar and return a reference to the same graph object, so more methods can be chained.

Additionally, almost every method accepts a callback function as a second parameter. This callback will be executed right after the graph properties are updated, but before is render to the screen.

The callback function can accept one optional parameter that represents the graph object from which the method is call upon.

> Note: The execution of the optional callback function is unique to that method call, so in order to execute that function more than ones it needs to be passed to the method on each call.

> Warning: The callback function will only run if there is a change in the graph properties. For example, if you try to change the axis `type` to `polar` but the axis already have that property value the function will skyp all calculations, including the callback, and continue with the normal flow.

___

To add data to the graph, you need to call the `addDataset` method specifying the type of the data you intend to create, the return value can be stored in a variable to later use.

    addDataset(datatype)
    addDataset(datatype, options) 

Where:

* `datatype` is one of the data types available : "linechart", "area", "heatmap" or "vectorfield".
* `options` is an object containing the [options](#linechart-options)  to change the default behavior and appearance of the dataset.

> Note. The options object has a lot of properties and complex structure, its use is intended for copying or generate datasets from another datasets. All its properties are breake down in the corresponding dataset methods, is best to use those instead.

The resulting dataset is bound to the graph, so in order to render the result, you must call the `draw` method of the graph after the dataset creation or any modification made to it.

Example:

    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");
    const graph = graph2D(element)
		      .axisDomain({
		          x : {start : -8, end : 8},
			  y : {start : -1.2, end : 1.2}
		       })
		      .containerSize({width : 800, height : 300});
    
    const data = graph.addDataset("linechart")
		      .dataX(linspace(-8, 8, 100))
		      .dataY((dataset)=>{
		          return dataset.dataX().map(x=>Math.cos(x));
		       });

    graph.draw();

Result:

![cosine_example](/assets/images/cosine_example.jpeg)

The details on how to manipulate the datasets will be discussed in its [corresponding](#datasets) section.

### Dynamic

This method lets you set or get the dynamic properties of each axis.

This method only is relevant if the axis `position` is set to `center`.
In this position, the axis text is located below the `x` axis and at the left of the `y` axis, and the two axis intersects at the coordinate `(0,0)`.

When that coordinate is no longer inside the graph area, the axis shift to remain visible and the text change positions relative to the axis base.

Those two are the behaviors that this method can change.

For example, in the next illustration, the axis shift when the `start` value of the `y` axis domain is bigger than zero.

![axis_dynamic](/assets/gifs/axis_dynamic.gif)

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

*Method:*

    axisDynamic()
    axisDynamic(dynamic)
    axisDynamic(dynamic, callback)

*Where:*

* `dynamic` is an object containing the following properties:
  * `x`: and object with the following properties:
    * `dynamic`: a boolean that determines whether the `x` axis text changes position relative to the base.
    * `contained`: a boolean that determines whether the `x` axis shifts to remain visible.
  * `y`: and object with the following properties:
    * `dynamic`: a boolean that determines whether the `y` axis text changes position relative to the base.
    * `contained`: a boolean that determines whether the `y` axis shifts to remain visible.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the properties of the axis dynamics are set but before the next render, this callback accepts an optional argument that represents the graph object from which the method is called upon.

*Returns:*

* An object representing the current properties of the axis dynamics if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon.

*Dafault values:*

    {
      x : {
        dynamic : true,
        contained : true
      },
      y : {
        dynamic : true,
        contained : true
      }
    }

___

### Overlap

This method lets you set or get the overlap properties of each axis.

This method only is relevant if the axis `position` is set to `center`.
In this position, the axis text may overlap with each other or with the axis itself.

To enhance visibility, a little area around each text is clear, so neither the base nor ticks will render on top of the text.

This method lets you modify that behavior.

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

*Method:*

  * `x`: a boolean representing whether a small area arround the text of the `x` axis should be cleared.
  * `y`: a boolean representing whether a small area arround the text of the `y` axis should be cleared.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the properties of the axis overlap are set but before the next render, this callback accepts an optional argument that represents the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Note: In the case that the text of one axis overlaps with the text of the other, the one render on top will be determined by the value of the `priority` property.

*Returns:*

* An object representing the current properties of the axis overlap if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon.

*Dafault values:*

The default values for the properties of the axis overlap are:

### Secondary Enable:

This method lets you enable the secondary set of axis.

Each graph have the capability of defining two sets of axis, the primary `x` and `y` axis are always defined while the secondary `x` and `y` can be defined independently.

The properties of the secondary axis can be manipulated in the same way the primaries can, but the axis must be defined first and the axis `position` must *NOT* be `center`.

Each dataset can decide what pair of axis use.

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

> Note: `center` positioned axis cannot have secondary axis defined.

*Method:*

    secondaryAxisEnable()
    secondaryAxisEnable(options)
    secondaryAxisEnable(options, callback)

*Where:*

* `options` is an object containing the following properties:
  * `x`: a boolean that determines whether the secondary `x` axis must be enable.
  * `y`: a boolean that determines whether the secondary `y` axis must be enable.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the properties of the secondary axis enable are set but before the next render, this callback accepts an optional argument that represents the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Note: The secondary axis will *not* be enabled if the axis `position` is set to `center`.

*Returns:*

* An object representing the current properties of the secondary axis enable if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Why the `end` value of the `y` axis is at the top and not the bottom? :
> Because of the convention of having the vertical axis values increase from bottom to top, this is a convention to follow for other similar properties.

> On that note, it is not necessary to have the `start` value be smaller than the `end` value. In that case, the axis "direction" will be reverted.

> Note: To change any secondary axis property, the corresponding axis must be enabled first.

## Grid

The graph can define the use of grids to improve the data reading. There are two types of grids:

* `Primary`: The primary grid runs along the axis ticks.
* `Secondary`: The secondary grid runs in between the axis ticks.

Each grid have an `x` and `y` component, and runs perpendicular to its corresponding axis.

For example, the `x` component of the `primary` grid is composed of parallel vertical lines extending the `x` axis ticks.

> Note: If the axis type is set to `polar` the grid behavior changes.

In the case that the axis position is set to `polar`, then the behavior of the grids are as follows:

* `Primary`: 
  * The `x` component of the primary grid is composed of concentric circles around the origin with radii equal to each tick in the `x` direction.
  * The `y` component of the primary grid is composed of rays coming out of the origin with equal angle variation.

* `Secondary`: 
  * The `x` component of the secondary grid is composed of concentric circles arround the origin with raii equal to values in between the ticks in the `x` direction.
  * The `y` component of the secondary grid is composed of rays coming out of the origin, with equal angle variation in between each ray of the `y` component of the primary grid.

## Utilities

The graph object implements some general utility methods to help you to move, zoom and resize the graph and all its components.

Three of the four methods set event listeners on the container div element, all these event perform changes on the graph properties.

As usual, all this methods accept an optional callback if you need aditional functionality.

The available utility methods are:

* `pointerMove`: Lets you pan the graph with a pointer based event (mouse and touch).
* `pointerZoom`: Lets you zoom the graph with a pointer based event (mouse and touch).
* `containerResize`: Lets you adjust the graph size with a resize observer event.
* `aspectRatio`: Sets the aspect ratio of an axis with respect of other.

> Note: The utilities `pointerMove` and `pointerZoom` are incompatibles when used with a *non* touch device.

It is importan to note that the utilities `pointerMove` and `pointerZoom` use both pointer based events, so if a mouse fire the event and are both enabled, only `pointerMove` will take effect. For this to work you must enable and disable the utilities manually.

This is not a problem when usin a movile (touch based) device. This is because diferent gestures are used each one, touch and grab for `pointerMove` and pinch for `pointerZoom`.

___

### Pointer Move:

This method allows you to move the graph using the pointer (mouse or touch).

This method creates a new instance of the event listener, discartign any previous one.

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to customize, the rest will be set to its default.

*Method:*

    pointerMove()
    pointerMove(options)

*Where:*

* `options` is an object with the following properties:
  * `enable`: a boolean tha determines whether the utility must be enabled.
  * `delay`: a number representing the delay in milliseconds of the throttle implementation.
  * `pointerCapture`: a boolean that determines whether the pointer event should be capture.
  * `defaultCursor`: a string that represent the default cursor. 
  * `hoverCursor`: a string that represent the cursor when its hovering the active area.
  * `moveCursor`: a string that represent the cursor when is performing the move.
  * `primaryAxis`: a boolean that determines if the move affects the `primary` axis.
  * `secondaryAxis`: a boolean that determines if the move affects the `secondary` axis.
  * `callback` : a function that runs afther the graph new properties are set but before the next render, this callback accepts an optional argument that represents the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Note: The properties of the graph after the move is made are computed in a throttle function to avoid overload de browser. The `delay` property affects how often that calculations are made.

> Note: The value of the `defaultCursor`, `hoverCursor`, `moveCursor` can be any of the standar cursor names.

> Note: When disabled, the cursor will be set to `defaultCursor`.

> Note: Unlike other methods, the `callback` function is contained inside the `options` object.

*Returns:*

* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon. 

*Default Values:*

The default values for the properties of the `pointerMove` method are as follow:

    {

When using the zoom with the `type` set to `"area" you can draw a rectangle, and the area of that rectangle will be represented by the axis after the mouse is released.

Also, while drawing the area, you can hold the `shift` key to move the origin of the rectangle.
In this mode, only zoom-in is available.

![zoom-area](/assets/gifs/zoom-area.gif)

When using the zoom whith the `type` set to `"drag"` you must click and drag to perform the zoom. Dragging to the right relative to the initial click will zoom-in, while gragging to the left will perform a zoom-out.

In this mode, the zoom conserve the axis aspect ratio.

# Datasets

## Line Chart:

The `linechart` dataset is use to create, as the name implies, line charts but also can create dispersion graphs.

It uses a set of datapoints that consist of two arrays of numbers with the same size representing the `[x, y]` coordinates of each point.

The main components of a line chart are:

* The data itself.
* The `lines` that can be draw connecting each datapoint.
* The `markers` that can be draw on each datapoint.
* The `error bars` that can be draw on each datapoint.

The datapoints and properties of that datapoints can be defined to be static or dynamic, meaning that its values can be static and never change or be computed on each draw and even be based on the values of other properties.

If you set any of the datapoint components to be dynamic, that component must be defined by a function of the type:

    generator()
    generator(dataset)
    generator(dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

These two optional arguments always holds the dataset and graph latest state at the moment of the call.

> Note: Unlike the callback that most methods accept, the generator function runs on every draw.

The `linechart` data generator must return an array of numbers.

Example:

First, lets create a static line chart.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisDomain({
      x : {start : -8, end : 8},
      y : {start : -1.2, end : 1.2}
    })
    .containerSize({width : 800,  height : 300})
    .pointerMove();

    //Creates the linechart
    const line_chart = my_graph.addDataset("linechart");

    //Creates the data arrays
    const x_data = linspace(-8, 8, 150);
    const y_data = x_data.map(x => Math.cos(x));
    
    //Add the data to the linechart
    line_chart.dataX(x_data).dataY(y_data);

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

*Result:*

![static-linechart1](/assets/gifs/static-linechart1.gif)

>Note: `linspace` is a utility function, you can learn more about this functions on the [extras](#extras) section.

The properties of the linechart can be easily modified, for example by adding to the last script.

    line_cart.lineColor("#cf0808");
    
    //Don't forget to call the draw() method after each change.
    my_graph.draw();

Changes the line color

![static-linechart2](/assets/images/static-linechart2.jpg)

Now let's recreate the same graph but using dynamic data instead.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisDomain({
      x : {start : -8, end : 8},
      y : {start : -1.2, end : 1.2}
    })
    .containerSize({width : 800,  height : 300})
    .pointerMove();

    //Creates the linechart and add the data
    const line_chart = my_graph.addDataset("linechart");

    line_chart.dataX((dataset, graph)=>{
      //This function will run on every draw
      //Inside this function, dataset makes reference to line_chart and 
      //graph to my_graph

      const domain = graph.axisDomain(); 

      //The return value must be an array of numbers
      return linspace(domain.x.start, domain.x.end, 150)
    })
    .dataY( dataset=>{
      //In this case we only need a reference to the dataset

      const x_values = dataset.dataX(); //From here we can get the generated x values and other non dynamic properties.

      const y = x_values.map(x=>Math.cos(x));

      //Again, the return value must be an array of numbers
      return y;
    });

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

    

*Result:*

![dynamic-linechart1](/assets/gifs/dynamic-linechart1.gif)

As shown, the graph can be moved indefinitely and the data moves along with it.

> Warning: You may only read static properties from dynamic data generators, this is because dynamic properties depend on the `x` and `y` data values, so calling those from a data generator will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `dataX()` or `draw()` method from the `x` data generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `dataY()` or `draw()` method from the `y` data generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Note: It is safe to call the `dataX()` method from within the `y` data generator and vice versa.

The creation of dynamic properties is slightly different. This is because the properties are assigned to each datapoint so the generator function depends directly on the `x` and `y` data components.

The generator function will be call once for each datapoint and must return a suitable value for that datapoint.

The generator can accept some optional parameters that must be call in the next order:

    generator(x, y, index, arrayX, arrayY, dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `x`: is the `x` value of the datapoint.
* `y`: is the `y` value of the datapoint.
* `index`: is the index corresponding to the `x` and `y` values.
* `arrayX`: is the complete arary of `x` data values.
* `arrayY`: is the complete arary of `y` data values.
* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

> Note: All the arguments of the property generator function are optional.

> Note: The property generator operates in a similar way of the array methods (map, forEach, etc).

For example, the line color of the last graph can be dynamically change to be dependent of the `y` values by adding:
    
    //Create a colormap
    const color = colorMap({
      from : -1,
      to : 1,
      type : "magnet"
    });

    line_chart.lineColor((x, y)=>{
      //In this case we only need access to the data values in the arguments.
      
      //The return value will be assigned to the corresponding datapoint
      return color(y);
    });

    my_graph.draw();

Result:

* `callback`: is a function that is run after the `id` is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the dataset object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: The `id` is used to identify the dataset, so the string must be unique among other datasets.

By default, the `id` is generated automatically to guarantee its uniqueness, so in the majority of cases it is best to leave it as it is.

*Returns:*

* A string representing the `id` of the dataset if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the dataset object from which the method is called upon.

___

### Index:

This method lets you set or get the index of the dataset.

The index is used to determine the order in which the datasets will be drawn.
The dataset with the lower index value will be drawn first and appear to be behind other datasets.

___

## Line Data

The data in the `linechart` is composed of two arrays of numbers with equal length. Each pair of numbers that share the same index in the arrays represent the `[x, y]` coordinates of one data point.

Each array must be defined independently.

___

### Data x:

* `callback`: is a function that is run after the data is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the dataset object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: Unlike the callback, If you define the data as a function, that function will be executed on each subsequent draw and the arguments will hold the latest state of the dataset and graph at the moment of the call. 

> Warning: Neither `dataX()` nor `draw()` should be called from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: Any dynamic property should not be read from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Note: It is safe to call static properties.

When the data is defined as a function, we say that is dynamically generated.

If the data is dynamically generated, its values are updated on each draw. It is important to note that the `draw()` method only updates the graph if a change is made to it or any of its assets, so if you change an external value, even if that value is used inside the data function, it will not be detected and the data will not update.

> Note: The `linechart` data generator functions are discussed in deep [here](#line-chart).

*Returns:*

* An array of numbers representing the `x` component of the datapoints if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the dataset object from which the method is called upon.

* `callback`: is a function that is run after the data is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the dataset object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: Unlike the callback, If you define the data as a function, that function will be executed on each subsequent draw and the arguments will hold the latest state of the dataset and graph at the moment of the call. 

> Warning: Neither `dataY()` nor `draw()` should be called from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: Any dynamic property should not be read from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Note: It is safe to call static properties.

When the data is defined as a function, we say that is dynamically generated.

If the data is dynamically generated, its values are updated on each draw. It is important to note that the `draw()` method only updates the graph if a change is made to it or any of its assets, so if you change an external value, even if that value is used inside the data function, it will not be detected and the data will not update.

> Note: The `linechart` data generator functions are discussed in deep [here](#line-chart).

*Returns:*

* An array of numbers representing the `y` component of the datapoints if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the dataset object from which the method is called upon.

For example, consider the data arrays:

    const r = linspace(1, 1, 200);          //[1,1,1, ..., 1]
    const theta = linspace(0, 2*Math.PI, 200);  //[0, 0.042, ..., 6.283]

    //Assign the data to the linechart
    line_chart.dataX(r).dataY(theta);

    //Don't forget to render the new state.
    my_graph.draw();

| `polar(false)`   |   `polar(true)`  |
|:----------------:|:----------------:|
|![linechart-polar-false](/assets/images/linechart-polar-false.jpg)|![linechart-polar-true](/assets/images/linechart-polar-true.jpg)|

When the `polar` property is set to `false` the linechart only shows a straight line but the data is correctly interpreted as a full circumference of radius one if the `polar` property is set as `true`.

*Returns:*
* A boolean that represents the linechart `polar` property value if no arguments are pass.

## Area:

The `area` dataset is used to show the area between two curves, for example when you need to represent the integral of a given function.

It uses two sets of datapoints, each consisting of two array of numbers representing the `[x, y]` coordinates of each point.

The two sets of datapoints can be defined to be static or dynamic, meaning that its values can be static and never change or be computed on each draw and even be based on the values of other properties.

If you set any of the datapoint components to be dynamic, that component must be defined by a function of the type:

    generator()
    generator(dataset)
    generator(dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

These two optional arguments always holds the dataset and graph latest state at the moment of the call.

> Note: Unlike the callback that most methods accept, the generator function runs on every draw.


First lets create a static `area` graph.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisDomain({
      x : {start : -12, end : 12},
      y : {start : -0.3, end : 1.1}
    })
    .containerSize({width : 800,  height : 300})
    .pointerMove();


    //Creates a simple linechart for reference
    const line_chart = my_graph.addDataset("linechart");

    const line_data_x = linspace(-12, 12, 150);
    const line_data_y = line_data_x.map(x => Math.sin(x)/x);

    line_chart.dataX(line_data_x).dataY(line_data_y);


    //Now creates the area graph.
    const area = my_graph.addDataset("area");

    //Creates the data arrays
    const area_data_x = linspace(-12, 12, 150);
    const area_data_y = area_data_x.map(x => Math.sin(x)/x); 

    //The area need two sets of data arrays
    const area_base_x = [-12, 12];
    const area_base_y : [0, 0];

    //Add the data to the area graph
    area.dataX(area_data_x)
        .dataY(area_data_y)
        .baseX(area_base_x)
        .baseY(area_base_y);

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

*Result:*

![static-area](/assets/gifs/static-area.gif)

>Note: `linspace` is a utility function, you can learn more about this functions on the [extras](#extras) section.

As shown, the area is being drawn between the `data` and the `base` curves. In this case, the `data` curve follows the `linechar` and the `base` curve follows the `x` axis, that is, a straight line from `[-12, 0]` to `[12, 0]`.

> Note: It is not necessary for the `base` to be a straight line, it can be any arbitrary curve.

> Note: It is not necessary for the `data` and `base` curves to share the same endpoints or datapoint number, they both are independent.

Now let's recreate the same graph but using dynamic data instead.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisDomain({
      x : {start : -12, end : 12},
      y : {start : -0.3, end : 1.1}
    })
    .containerSize({width : 800,  height : 300})
    .pointerMove();


    //Creates a simple linechart for reference
    const line_chart = my_graph.addDataset("linechart");

    //The linechart data remains static
    const line_data_x = linspace(-12, 12, 150);
    const line_data_y = line_data_x.map(x => Math.sin(x)/x);

    line_chart.dataX(line_data_x).dataY(line_data_y);



    //Now creates the area graph ans add the data.
    const area = my_graph.addDataset("area");

    area.dataX((dataset, graph)=>{
      //This function will run on every draw
      //Inside this function, dataset makes reference to line_chart and 
      //graph to my_graph

      const domain = graph.axisDomain(); 

      //The return value must be an array of numbers
      return linspace(domain.x.start, domain.x.end, 150)
    })
    .dataY( dataset=>{
      //In this case we only need a reference to the dataset

      const x_values = dataset.dataX(); //From here we can get the generated x values

      const y = x_values.map(x=>Math.sin(x)/x);

      //Again, the return value must be an array of numbers
      return y;
    } )
    .baseX((dataset, graph)=>{
      const domain = graph.axisDomain();

      //In this case only the axis endpoints are need.
      return [domain.x.start, domain.x.end];
    })
    .baseY([0, 0]);

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

*Result:*

![dynamic-area](/assets/gifs/dynamic-area.gif)

As shown, the graph can be moved indefinitely and the area moves along with it.

> Warning: You must not call the `dataX()` or `draw()` method from the `x` data generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `dataY()` or `draw()` method from the `y` data generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `baseX()` or `draw()` method from the `x` base generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `baseY()` or `draw()` method from the `y` base generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> It is safe to call every other method from the generator functions.

* A reference to the dataset object from which the method is called upon.

___

## Area Data

The data in the `area` dataset is composed of two different sets each with two arrays of numbers with equal length. Each pair of numbers that share the same index in the arrays represent the `[x, y]` coordinates of one data point.

Each set of data is independent and are named the `data` and the `base` curves. The area is drawn between these two curves.

Each array must be defined independently.

> Warning: Neither `dataX()` nor `draw()` should be called from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

When the data is defined as a function, we say that is dynamically generated.

If the data is dynamically generated, its values are updated on each draw. It is important to note that the `draw()` method only updates the graph if a change is made to it or any of its assets, so if you change an external value, even if that value is used inside the data function, it will not be detected and the data will not update.

> Warning: Neither `dataY()` nor `draw()` should be called from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

When the data is defined as a function, we say that is dynamically generated.

If the data is dynamically generated, its values are updated on each draw. It is important to note that the `draw()` method only updates the graph if a change is made to it or any of its assets, so if you change an external value, even if that value is used inside the data function, it will not be detected and the base will not update.

> Warning: Neither `baseX()` nor `draw()` should be called from within the `base` function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

When the base is defined as a function, we say that is dynamically generated.

If the base is dynamically generated, its values are updated on each draw.

___

## Heatmap

The `heatmap` dataset is used to represent two dimensional functions or scalar fields. The field values is represented as a color.

The datapoints in this dataset are represented by three arrays, two of which are used to determine the location of the datapoint, these are call the `meshX` and `meshY` arrays and the third stores the value itself, this is the `data` array.

These arrays have a specific structure: All three are two-dimensional matrices

    const data = [
      [1,2,3],
      [4,5,6],
      [7,8,9]
    ]

That is, and array that holds arrays of numbers. Each of the inner arrays can have different lengths as long that difference is present in `meshX`, `meshY` and `data` at the same location.

> Note: The `meshX`, `meshY` and `data` arrays must have the same structure.

The datapoints are characterized with two indices `(i, j)` that represent the row and column of the matrices.

So the `x` coordinate of the datapoint is at `meshX[i][j]`, the `y` coordinate at `meshY[i][j]` and its value is `data[i][j]`.

The mesh, data and datapoint properties can be defined to be static or dynamic, meaning that its values can be static and never change or be computed on each draw and even be based on the values of other properties.

Example:

First, lets create a static `heatmap` graph.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisPosition("bottom-left")
    .primaryGrid({
      grid : {enable : false}
    })
    .secondaryGrid({
      grid : {enable : false}
    })
    .containerSize({width : 400, height : 400})
    .pointerMove();

    

    //Creates the heatmap
    const heat_map = my_graph.addDataset("heatmap");

    //Creates the mesh
    const x_positions = linspace(-4, 4, 100);
    const y_positions = linspace(-4, 4, 100);
    const [x_mesh, y_mesh] = meshgrid(x_positions, y_positions);

    //Creates the data
    const values = [];
    
    for(let i=0; i < x_mesh.length; i++){
      values.push([]);
      for(let j=0; j<x_mesh[i].length; j++){
        const x = x_mesh[i][j];
        const y = y_mesh[i][j];
        const r = Math.hypot(x, y);

        values[i].push(Math.cos(r));    
      }
    }

    //Add the data to the heatmap
    heat_map.meshX(x_mesh).meshY(y_mesh).data(values);

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

*Result:*

![static-heatmap](/assets/gifs/static-heatmap.gif)

>Note: `linspace` and `meshgrid` are utility functions, you can learn more about this functions on the [extras](#extras) section.

As shown, the `heatmap` position and values are static and remain unchanged.

Now let's make the mesh dynamic. To do that, we need to define each mesh component as a generator function.

The mesh generator function has the form:

    generator()
    generator(dataset)
    generator(dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

These two optional arguments always holds the dataset and graph latest state at the moment of the call.

> Note: Unlike the callback that most methods accept, the generator function runs on every draw.

The mesh generator function must return the mesh values.

We will keep the last script up until the data is add to the `heatmap`.

    //Add the data to the heatmap
    heat_map.meshX((dataset, graph)=>{
      //This function will run on every draw
      //Inside this function, dataset makes reference to heat_map and 
      //graph to my_graph

Now in this case, the mesh moves along with the axis and appears always at the center of the graph, but the `heatmap` values are still static.

To change that, the data values must be defined as a generator function as well. This function will be call once for each datapoint position and must return a value for that datapoint.

The `heatmap` data generator can accept some optional parameters that must be call in the next order:

    generator(x, y, i, j, meshX, meshY, dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `x`: is the `x` position of the datapoint.
* `y`: is the `y` position of the datapoint.
* `i`: is the `i` index corresponding to the `x` and `y` values.
* `j`: is the `j` index corresponding to the `x` and `y` values.
* `meshX`: is the complete `meshX` array.
* `meshY`: is the complete `meshY` array.
* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

> Note: All the arguments of the data generator function are optional.

> Note: The data generator operates in a similar way of the array methods (map, forEach, etc).

In our example, instead of defining the data statically, we will use a generator:

    heat_map.data((x, y)=>{
      //This function will run on every draw
      //In this case we only need the x and y positions.

      const r = Math.hypot(x,y);

      //Return the data value at each datapoint
      return Math.cos(2*r);
    })
    
    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

*Result:*

As shown, the data moves along with the axis and mesh.

Finally, some properties can be dynamic too. The `heatmap` property generator function in a similar manner than the data generator. 

The function will be called once for each datapoint and must return a suitable property value.

The `heatmap` property generator can accept some optional parameters that must be call in the next order:

    generator(value, x, y, i, j, data, meshX, meshY, dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `value`: is the value of the datapoint.
* `x`: is the `x` position of the datapoint.
* `y`: is the `y` position of the datapoint.
* `i`: is the `i` index corresponding to the `x` and `y` values.
* `j`: is the `j` index corresponding to the `x` and `y` values.
* `data`: is the complete `data` array.
* `meshX`: is the complete `meshX` array.
* `meshY`: is the complete `meshY` array.
* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

> Note: All the arguments of the data generator function are optional.

> Note: The data generator operates in a similar way of the array methosds (map, forEach, etc).

In the last script we can add:

    heat_map.opacity((value, x, y)=>{
      //This function will run on each draw
      //In this case we only need the datapoint value

      const opacity_map = mapping({ from:[-1,1], to:[0,1] });

      //The generator function must return a suitable value.
      return opacity_map.map(value);
    });

    //Draw the graph after any change

When the mesh is defined as a function, we say that is dynamically generated.

If the mesh is dynamically generated, its values are updated on each draw. It is important to note that the `draw()` method only updates the graph if a change is made to it or any of its assets, so if you change an external value, even if that value is used inside the mesh function, it will not be detected and the data will not update.

> Note: The `heatmap` property generator functions are discussed in deep [here](#heatmap).

If the color is defined as one of the predefined color maps, it will be considered dynamic. In this case, the color map range will be calculated automatically on each draw to accommodate the data.

This may be misleading if the data range changes constantly.

*Returns:*

* A two-dimensional matrix of strings representing the `color` at each datapoint if no argument is pass.
* A reference to the dataset object from which the method is called upon.

## Vector Field:

The `vectorfield` is used to create, as the name implies, two-dimensional vector field graphs. It can calso be used to draw single vectors or arrows.

The datapoints in this dataset are represented by four arrays, two of which are used to determine the location of the datapoint, these are call the `meshX` and `meshY` arrays and the other two stores the data values, these are the `dataX` and `dataY` arrays.

These arrays have a specific structure: All four are two-dimensional matrices

    const data = [
      [1,2,3],
      [4,5,6],
      [7,8,9]
    ]

That is, and array that holds arrays of numbers. Each of the inner arrays can have different lengths as long that difference is present in `meshX`, `meshY`, `dataX` and `dataY` at the same location.

> Note: The `meshX`, `meshY`, `dataX` and `dataY` arrays must have the same structure.

The datapoints are characterized with two indices `(i, j)` that represent the row and column of the matrices.

So the `x` coordinate of the datapoint is at `meshX[i][j]`, the `y` coordinate at `meshY[i][j]`, the `x` component of the vector is at `dataX[i][j]` and the `y` component at `dataY[i][j]`.

The mesh, data and datapoint properties can be defined to be static or dynamic, meaning that its values can be static and never change or be computed on each draw and even be based on the values of other properties.

Example:

First, lest create a static `vectorfield` graph.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisDomain({
      x : {start : -3, end : 3},
      y : {start : -3, end : 3}
    })
    .containerSize({width:400, height:400})
    .pointerMove();

    

    //Creates the vectorfield
    const vector_field = my_graph.addDataset("vectorfield");

    //Creates the mesh
    const x_positions = linspace(-3, 3, 23);
    const y_positions = linspace(-3, 3, 23);
    const [x_mesh, y_mesh] = meshgrid(x_positions, y_positions);

    //Creates the data
    const x_values = [];
    const y_values = [];

    for(let i=0; i < x_mesh.length; i++){
      x_values.push([]);
      y_values.push([]);
      for(let j=0; j < x_mesh[i].length; j++){
        const x = x_mesh[i][j];
        const y = y_mesh[i][j];
        
        x_values[i].push(Math.sin(x + y));
        y_values[i].push(Math.cos(x - y));
      }
    }

    //Add the data to the vectorfield
    vector_field.meshX(x_mesh)
    .meshY(y_mesh)
    .dataX(x_values)
    .dataY(y_values);

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

*Result:*

![static-vectorfield](/assets/gifs/static-vectorfield.gif)

>Note: `linspace` and `meshgrid` are utility functions, you can learn more about this functions on the [extras](#extras) section.

As shown, the `vectorfield` position and values are static and remain unchanged.

Now let's make the mesh dynamic. To do that, we need to define each mesh component as a generator function.

The mesh generator function has the form:

    generator()
    generator(dataset)
    generator(dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

These two optional arguments always holds the dataset and graph latest state at the moment of the call.

> Note: Unlike the callback that most methods accept, the generator function runs on every draw.

The mesh generator function must return the mesh values.

We will keep the last script up until the data is add to the `vectorfield`.

    //Add the data to the vectorfield
    vector_field.meshX((dataset, graph)=>{
      //This function will run on every draw
      //Inside this function, dataset makes reference to vector_field and 
      //graph to my_graph

      const domain = graph.axisDomain();

      const x_positions = linspace(domain.x.start, domain.x.end, 25);
      const y_positions = linspace(domain.y.start, domain.y.end, 25);
      const [x_mesh, y_mesh] = meshgrid(x_positions, y_positions);

      //The return value must be the x mesh component.
      return x_mesh;
    })
    meshY((dataset, graph)=>{
      const domain = graph.axisDomain();

      const x_positions = linspace(domain.x.start, domain.x.end, 25);
      const y_positions = linspace(domain.y.start, domain.y.end, 25);
      const [x_mesh, y_mesh] = meshgrid(x_positions, y_positions);

      //This time we return the y mesh component.
      return y_mesh;
    })
    .dataX(x_values)
    .dataY(y_values)

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

As shown, the `mesX` and `meshY` generator function are very similar, so we can condense them into a single function.

    //Creates the mesh generator function
    function getMesh(graph){
      const domain = graph.axisDomain();

      const x_positions = linspace(domain.x.start, domain.x.end, 23);
      const y_positions = linspace(domain.y.start, domain.y.end, 23);
      const [x_mesh, y_mesh] = meshgrid(x_positions, y_positions);

      return {x_mesh, y_mesh};
    }



    //Add the data to the vectorfield
    vector_field.meshX((dataset, graph)=>getMesh(graph).x_mesh)
    meshY((dataset, graph)=>getMesh(graph).y_mesh)
    .dataX(x_values)
    .dataY(y_values)

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

*Result:*

![dynamic-vectorfield1](/assets/gifs/dynamic-vectorfield1.gif)

> Warning: You may only read static properties and data from dynamic mesh generators, this is because dynamic properties depend on the `x` and `y` mesh values, so calling those from a data generator will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `meshX()` ot `draw()` methods from the `x` mesh generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `meshY()` ot `draw()` methods from the `y` mesh generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Note: It is safe to call the `meshX()` method from within the `y` mesh generator and vice versa.

Now in this case, the mesh moves along with the axis and appears always at the center of the graph, but the `heatmap` values are still static.

To change that, the data values must be defined as a generator function as well. This function will be call once for each datapoint position and must return a value for that datapoint.

The `vectorfield` data generator can accept some optional parameters that must be call in the next order:

    generator(x, y, i, j, meshX, meshY, dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `x`: is the `x` position of the datapoint.
* `y`: is the `y` position of the datapoint.
* `i`: is the `i` index corresponding to the `x` and `y` values.
* `j`: is the `j` index corresponding to the `x` and `y` values.
* `meshX`: is the complete `meshX` array.
* `meshY`: is the complete `meshY` array.
* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

> Note: All the arguments of the data generator function are optional.

> Note: The data generator operates in a similar way of the array methods (map, forEach, etc).

In our example, instead of defining the data statically, we will use a generator:

    //vector_field.dataX((x,y)=>{
      //This function will run on every draw
      //In this case we only need the x and y positions.

> Warning: You may only read static properties from dynamic data generators, this is because dynamic properties depend on the mesh values, so calling those from a data generator will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `dataX()` or `draw()` methods from the x data generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `dataY()` or `draw()` methods from the y data generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

As shown, the data now moves along with the axis and mesh.

But there is a catch, the vectors appear to change size and rotate as the graph moves. This is because the mesh positions remain constant relative to the graph rect, but no to the axis.

To fix that we need to make shure the mesh values always land on the same position relative to the axis. 

The `getMesh` will be replaced by:

    //Creates the mesh generator function
    function getMesh(graph){
      const domain = graph.axisDomain();
      const delta = 0.25;
      const x_positions = [];
      const y_positions = [];

      let x_current = Math.floor(domain.x.start);
      while(x_current < Math.ceil(domain.x.end + delta)){
        x_positions.push(x_current);
        x_current += delta;
      }

      let y_current = Math.floor(domain.y.start);
      while(y_current < Math.ceil(domain.y.end + delta)){
        y_positions.push(y_current);
        y_current += delta;
      }

      const [x_mesh, y_mesh] = meshgrid(x_positions, y_positions);

      return {x_mesh, y_mesh};
    }

*Result:*

Finally, some properties can be dynamic too. The `vectorfield` property generator function in a similar manner than the data generator. 

The function will be called once for each datapoint and must return a suitable property value.

The `vectorfield` property generator can accept some optional parameters that must be call in the next order:

    generator(vectorX, vectorY, x, y, i, j, dataX, dataY, meshX, meshY, dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `vectorX`: is the value of the datapoint `x` component.
* `vectorY`: is the value of the datapoint `y` component.

* `meshY`: is the complete `meshY` array.
* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

> Note: All the arguments of the data generator function are optional.

> Note: The data generator operates in a similar way of the array methosds (map, forEach, etc).

In the last script we can add:

    //Create a colormap´
    const color = colorMap({
      from : -Math.PI,
      to : Math.PI,
      type : "royal"
    });

    vector_field.color((x_value, y_value)=>{
      //In this case we can only need the x and y vector values;

      const angle = Math.atan2(y, x);

      //The return value will be assigned to the corresponding datapoint
      return color(angle);
    });

    my_graph.draw();

For example, consither the following graph.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisDomain({
      x : {start : -3, end : 3},
      y : {start : -3, end : 3}
    })
    .axisPosition("bottom-left")
    .containerSize({width:450, height:400});


    //Creates a heatmap
    const heat_map = my_graph.addDataset("heatmap");

    function getMesh(graph){
      const domain = graph.axisDomain();
      
      const x_positions = linspace(domain.x.start, domain.x.end, 100); 
      const y_positions = linspace(domain.y.start, domain.y.end, 100);
      const [x_mesh, y_mesh] = meshgrid(x_positions, y_positions);

    }

    //Add the data
    heat_map.meshX((dataset, graph)=>getMesh(graph).x_mesh)
    .meshY((dataset, graph)=>getMesh(graph).y_mesh)
    .data((x,y)=>peaks(x,y))

    //Finally, draws the graph.
    my_graph.draw();

*Result:*

![colorbar-1](/assets/images/colorbar-1.jpg)

To add a color bar to this graph, it's as simple as adding the next code before drawing the graph.

    //Creates the colorbar
    const color_bar = my_graph.addColorbar();

    //Binds the colorbar to the heatmap previously created.
    color_bar.data(heat_map.id());

    //Because in the default configuration, the margins are
    //changed in order to accommodate the colorbar, and we don't want the 
    //graph to be distorted.
    my_graph.aspectRatio({anchor:0}).draw();

*Result:*

![colorbar-2](/assets/images/colorbar-2.jpg)

A title can be easily be added.

    color_bar.title({text : "Peaks Function"});

    my_graph.aspectRatio({anchor:0}).draw();

*Result:*

![colorbar-3](/assets/images/colorbar-3.jpg)

* `callback`: is a function that is run after the colorbar `enable` property is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the colorbar object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

*Returns:*

* A bolean representing the `enable` status of the `colorbar`.
* A reference to the colorbar object from which the method is called upon.

*Default Value:*

* The default values for the `enable` property of the `colorbar` is `true`.

### Data:

This method lets you set or get the `colorbar` data.

*Method:*

    data()
    data(options)
    data(options, callback)

*Where:*

* `options`: represent the data of the `colorbar`. It can be one of the following options:
  * The id string of a `heatmap` dataset.
  * An array of objects, each of those objects represent one mark in the color bar and must have the following properties:
    * `color`: a string representing the color of the mark.
    * `label`: a string with the label of the mark.
    * `position`: a number represinting the position of the mark in the `colorbar`.
* `callback`: is a function that is run after the `data` is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the colorbar object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: The `position` property must be a number between 0 and 1, being 0 the start of the color bar, and 1 the end.

> Note: The `color` string can be in the format `"#rrggbb"` or be any of the standard color names.

In case of using an `id` string, this must belong to a `heatmap` dataset, and the `colorbar` will use the entire range of data.

*Returns:*

* An object with the `color`, `label` and `position` of each mark in the `colorbar` if no argument is pass.
* A reference to the colorbar object from which the method is called upon.

*Default Value:*

* There is no default value, if the data is not set, the `colorbar` will be a blank rectangle.  

___

### Position:

This method lets you set or get the `colorbar` `position`.

*Method:*

    position()
    position(option)
    position(option, callback)

*Where:*

* `option`: represents the `colobar` position. It can be one of the following options:
  * A string with one of the predefined positions:
    * `"x-start"` will position the `colorbar` at the left. 
    * `"x-end"` will position the `colorbar` at the right.
    * `"y-start"` will position the `colorbar` at the bottom. 
    * `"y-end"` will position the `colorbar` at the top.
  * An object with the following properties to position the `colorbar` manually:
    * `x`: a number with the `colorbar` `x` coordinate.
    * `y`: a number with the `colorbar` `y` coordinate.
    * `orientation`: a string with the `colorbar` `orientation`. It can be `"vertial"` or `"horizontal"`.
* `callback`: is a function that is run after the `position` is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the colorbar object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: If the `position` is set to one of the predefined positions, the graph `margins` will be changed to accommodate the `colorbar`. This will potentially change the axis aspect ratio.

> Note: The `x` and `y` values represent the coordinates of the top left `colorbar` corner relative to the client rect.

*Returns:*

* A string representing the `colorbar` `position` if no argument is pass.
* A reference to the colorbar object from which the method is called upon.

> Note: The returned string will be one of the predefined positions or `"floating"` if was manually defined.

*Default Value:*

* The default values for the `colorbar` `position` is `"x-end"`.

___

### Ticks:

This method lets you set or get the `colorbar` `tick` properties.

*Method*:

    ticks()
    ticks(options)
    ticks(options, callback)

*Where:*

* `options`: is an object with the folowing properties:
  * `density`: represents the number of ticks in the `colorbar`. It can be one of the following options:
    * A number representing the number of ticks.
    * An array of strings, the length of the array will be the number of ticks and the strings the label of each one.
    * An array of objects, each object with the following properties:
      * `label`: a string representing the label of the tick.
      * `position`: a number representing the position of the tick.
  * `color`: a string representing the color of the tick.
  * `opacity`: a number representing the opacity of the tick.
  * `style`: a string representing the style of the tick.
  * `width`: a number representing the line width of the tick.
* `callback`: is a function that is run after the `position` is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the colorbar object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: The
