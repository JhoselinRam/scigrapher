SciGrapher.js is a JavaScript/TypeScript library capable of producing high quality scientific oriented graphs on the browser with minimum configuration. It's based on the HTML canvas element to ensure high responsively and avoid overload the DOM with potentially hundreds of elements.

#### What do I mean with "scientific oriented"?

SciGrapher.js, unlike other tools like Chart.js or D3.js, is not a general purpose charting library, its goal is to accurately represent numeric data generated by mathematical equations or other (physical) sources. The resulting graphs are closer to those generated by MATLAB or Matplotlib, rather than an illustrative panel, for example.

At the moment, the library offers four chart types, including:

- Line chart, this can be used to generate dispersion graphs as well.
- Area, used to represent the area between two curves.
- Heatmap, to represent scalar fields.
- Vector field, to represent two-dimensional vector fields.

## Installation

Not available yet. Some minor bugs are being patch.

## Usage

Each graph is controlled by a single object created by calling the `graph2D` function.

    graph2D(element)
    graph2D(element, options)

Where
* `element` is a div element.
* `options` is an object containing the [options](#graph-options) to change the default behavior and appearance of the graph.

> Note: The options object has a lot of properties and complex structure, its use is intended for copying or generate graphs from another graphs. All its properties are breake down in the `graph2D` methods, is best to use those instead.

To start, call the `graph2D` function and assign the object generated to a variable, use its methods to change the appearance and behavior to your needs and finally call the `draw` method to render the final result.
The methods can be chained.

HTML:

    <body>
       <div id="my-graph"></div>
    </body>

JS:

    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");
    const graph = graph2D(element).axisPoition("center").draw();

Result:

![default_graph](/assets/images/default_graph.jpg)

Almost every method is overcharged, so you can set or get the properties, for example calling `graph.axisType()` will return the current axis type used in the graph, and calling `graph.axisType("polar")` will set the graph axis type to polar and return a reference to the same graph object, so more methods can be chained.

Additionally, almost every method accepts a callback function as a second parameter. This callback will be executed right after the graph properties are updated, but before is render to the screen.

The callback function can accept one optional parameter that represents the graph object from which the method is call upon.

> Note: The execution of the optional callback function is unique to that method call, so in order to execute that function more than ones it needs to be passed to the method on each call.

> Warning: The callback function will only run if there is a change in the graph properties. For example, if you try to change the axis `type` to `polar` but the axis already have that property value the function will skyp all calculations, including the callback, and continue with the normal flow.

___

To add data to the graph, you need to call the `addDataset` method specifying the type of the data you intend to create, the return value can be stored in a variable to later use.

    addDataset(datatype)
    addDataset(datatype, options) 

Where:

* `datatype` is one of the data types available : "linechart", "area", "heatmap" or "vectorfield".
* `options` is an object containing the [options](#linechart-options)  to change the default behavior and appearance of the dataset.

> Note. The options object has a lot of properties and complex structure, its use is intended for copying or generate datasets from another datasets. All its properties are breake down in the corresponding dataset methods, is best to use those instead.

The resulting dataset is bound to the graph, so in order to render the result, you must call the `draw` method of the graph after the dataset creation or any modification made to it.

Example:

    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");
    const graph = graph2D(element)
		      .axisDomain({
		          x : {start : -8, end : 8},
			  y : {start : -1.2, end : 1.2}
		       })
		      .containerSize({width : 800, height : 300});
    
    const data = graph.addDataset("linechart")
		      .dataX(linspace(-8, 8, 100))
		      .dataY((dataset)=>{
		          return dataset.dataX().map(x=>Math.cos(x));
		       });

    graph.draw();

Result:

![cosine_example](/assets/images/cosine_example.jpeg)

The details on how to manipulate the datasets will be discussed in its [corresponding](#datasets) section.

### Dynamic

This method lets you set or get the dynamic properties of each axis.

This method only is relevant if the axis `position` is set to `center`.
In this position, the axis text is located below the `x` axis and at the left of the `y` axis, and the two axis intersects at the coordinate `(0,0)`.

When that coordinate is no longer inside the graph area, the axis shift to remain visible and the text change positions relative to the axis base.

Those two are the behaviors that this method can change.

For example, in the next illustration, the axis shift when the `start` value of the `y` axis domain is bigger than zero.

![axis_dynamic](/assets/gifs/axis_dynamic.gif)

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

*Method:*

    axisDynamic()
    axisDynamic(dynamic)
    axisDynamic(dynamic, callback)

*Where:*

* `dynamic` is an object containing the following properties:
  * `x`: and object with the following properties:
    * `dynamic`: a boolean that determines whether the `x` axis text changes position relative to the base.
    * `contained`: a boolean that determines whether the `x` axis shifts to remain visible.
  * `y`: and object with the following properties:
    * `dynamic`: a boolean that determines whether the `y` axis text changes position relative to the base.
    * `contained`: a boolean that determines whether the `y` axis shifts to remain visible.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the properties of the axis dynamics are set but before the next render, this callback accepts an optional argument that represents the graph object from which the method is called upon.

*Returns:*

* An object representing the current properties of the axis dynamics if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon.

*Dafault values:*

    {
      x : {
        dynamic : true,
        contained : true
      },
      y : {
        dynamic : true,
        contained : true
      }
    }

___

### Overlap

This method lets you set or get the overlap properties of each axis.

This method only is relevant if the axis `position` is set to `center`.
In this position, the axis text may overlap with each other or with the axis itself.

To enhance visibility, a little area around each text is clear, so neither the base nor ticks will render on top of the text.

This method lets you modify that behavior.

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

*Method:*

  * `x`: a boolean representing whether a small area arround the text of the `x` axis should be cleared.
  * `y`: a boolean representing whether a small area arround the text of the `y` axis should be cleared.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the properties of the axis overlap are set but before the next render, this callback accepts an optional argument that represents the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Note: In the case that the text of one axis overlaps with the text of the other, the one render on top will be determined by the value of the `priority` property.

*Returns:*

* An object representing the current properties of the axis overlap if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon.

*Dafault values:*

The default values for the properties of the axis overlap are:

### Secondary Enable:

This method lets you enable the secondary set of axis.

Each graph have the capability of defining two sets of axis, the primary `x` and `y` axis are always defined while the secondary `x` and `y` can be defined independently.

The properties of the secondary axis can be manipulated in the same way the primaries can, but the axis must be defined first and the axis `position` must *NOT* be `center`.

Each dataset can decide what pair of axis use.

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to change and only that values will be updated, leaving the rest as they are.

> Note: `center` positioned axis cannot have secondary axis defined.

*Method:*

    secondaryAxisEnable()
    secondaryAxisEnable(options)
    secondaryAxisEnable(options, callback)

*Where:*

* `options` is an object containing the following properties:
  * `x`: a boolean that determines whether the secondary `x` axis must be enable.
  * `y`: a boolean that determines whether the secondary `y` axis must be enable.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the properties of the secondary axis enable are set but before the next render, this callback accepts an optional argument that represents the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Note: The secondary axis will *not* be enabled if the axis `position` is set to `center`.

*Returns:*

* An object representing the current properties of the secondary axis enable if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Why the `end` value of the `y` axis is at the top and not the bottom? :
> Because of the convention of having the vertical axis values increase from bottom to top, this is a convention to follow for other similar properties.

> On that note, it is not necessary to have the `start` value be smaller than the `end` value. In that case, the axis "direction" will be reverted.

> Note: To change any secondary axis property, the corresponding axis must be enabled first.

## Grid

The graph can define the use of grids to improve the data reading. There are two types of grids:

* `Primary`: The primary grid runs along the axis ticks.
* `Secondary`: The secondary grid runs in between the axis ticks.

Each grid have an `x` and `y` component, and runs perpendicular to its corresponding axis.

For example, the `x` component of the `primary` grid is composed of parallel vertical lines extending the `x` axis ticks.

> Note: If the axis type is set to `polar` the grid behavior changes.

In the case that the axis position is set to `polar`, then the behavior of the grids are as follows:

* `Primary`: 
  * The `x` component of the primary grid is composed of concentric circles around the origin with radii equal to each tick in the `x` direction.
  * The `y` component of the primary grid is composed of rays coming out of the origin with equal angle variation.

* `Secondary`: 
  * The `x` component of the secondary grid is composed of concentric circles arround the origin with raii equal to values in between the ticks in the `x` direction.
  * The `y` component of the secondary grid is composed of rays coming out of the origin, with equal angle variation in between each ray of the `y` component of the primary grid.

## Utilities

The graph object implements some general utility methods to help you to move, zoom and resize the graph and all its components.

Three of the four methods set event listeners on the container div element, all these event perform changes on the graph properties.

As usual, all this methods accept an optional callback if you need aditional functionality.

The available utility methods are:

* `pointerMove`: Lets you pan the graph with a pointer based event (mouse and touch).
* `pointerZoom`: Lets you zoom the graph with a pointer based event (mouse and touch).
* `containerResize`: Lets you adjust the graph size with a resize observer event.
* `aspectRatio`: Sets the aspect ratio of an axis with respect of other.

> Note: The utilities `pointerMove` and `pointerZoom` are incompatibles when used with a *non* touch device.

It is importan to note that the utilities `pointerMove` and `pointerZoom` use both pointer based events, so if a mouse fire the event and are both enabled, only `pointerMove` will take effect. For this to work you must enable and disable the utilities manually.

This is not a problem when usin a movile (touch based) device. This is because diferent gestures are used each one, touch and grab for `pointerMove` and pinch for `pointerZoom`.

___

### Pointer Move:

This method allows you to move the graph using the pointer (mouse or touch).

This method creates a new instance of the event listener, discartign any previous one.

It is only necessary to define the values that you want to customize, the rest will be set to its default.

*Method:*

    pointerMove()
    pointerMove(options)

*Where:*

* `options` is an object with the following properties:
  * `enable`: a boolean tha determines whether the utility must be enabled.
  * `delay`: a number representing the delay in milliseconds of the throttle implementation.
  * `pointerCapture`: a boolean that determines whether the pointer event should be capture.
  * `defaultCursor`: a string that represent the default cursor. 
  * `hoverCursor`: a string that represent the cursor when its hovering the active area.
  * `moveCursor`: a string that represent the cursor when is performing the move.
  * `primaryAxis`: a boolean that determines if the move affects the `primary` axis.
  * `secondaryAxis`: a boolean that determines if the move affects the `secondary` axis.
  * `callback` : a function that runs afther the graph new properties are set but before the next render, this callback accepts an optional argument that represents the graph object from which the method is called upon.

> Note: The properties of the graph after the move is made are computed in a throttle function to avoid overload de browser. The `delay` property affects how often that calculations are made.

> Note: The value of the `defaultCursor`, `hoverCursor`, `moveCursor` can be any of the standar cursor names.

> Note: When disabled, the cursor will be set to `defaultCursor`.

> Note: Unlike other methods, the `callback` function is contained inside the `options` object.

*Returns:*

* A reference to the graph object from which the method is called upon. 

*Default Values:*

The default values for the properties of the `pointerMove` method are as follow:

    {

When using the zoom with the `type` set to `"area" you can draw a rectangle, and the area of that rectangle will be represented by the axis after the mouse is released.

Also, while drawing the area, you can hold the `shift` key to move the origin of the rectangle.
In this mode, only zoom-in is available.

![zoom-area](/assets/gifs/zoom-area.gif)

When using the zoom whith the `type` set to `"drag"` you must click and drag to perform the zoom. Dragging to the right relative to the initial click will zoom-in, while gragging to the left will perform a zoom-out.

In this mode, the zoom conserve the axis aspect ratio.

# Datasets

## Line Chart:

The `linechart` dataset is use to create, as the name implies, line charts but also can create dispersion graphs.

It uses a set of datapoints that consist of two arrays of numbers with the same size representing the `[x, y]` coordinates of each point.

The main components of a line chart are:

* The data itself.
* The `lines` that can be draw connecting each datapoint.
* The `markers` that can be draw on each datapoint.
* The `error bars` that can be draw on each datapoint.

The datapoints and properties of that datapoints can be defined to be static or dynamic, meaning that its values can be static and never change or be computed on each draw and even be based on the values of other properties.

If you set any of the datapoint `x` or `y` component to be dynamic, that component must be defined by a function of the type:

    generator()
    generator(dataset)
    generator(dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

These two optional arguments always holds the dataset and graph latest state at the moment of the call.

> Note: Unlike the callback that most methods accept, the generator function runs on every draw.

Example:

First, lets create a static line chart.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisDomain({
      x : {start : -8, end : 8},
      y : {start : -1.2, end : 1.2}
    })
    .containerSize({width : 800,  height : 300})
    .pointerMove();

    //Creates the linechart
    const line_chart = my_graph.addDataset("linechart");

    //Creates the data number arrays
    const x_data = linspace(-8, 8, 150);
    const y_data = x_data.map(x => Math.cos(x));
    
    //Add the data to the linechart
    line_chart.dataX(x_data).dataY(y_data);

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

Result:

>Note: `linspace` is a utility function, you can learn more about this functions on the [extras](#extras) section.

The properties of the linechart can be easily modified, for example by adding to the last script.

    line_cart.lineColor("#cf0808");
    
    //Don't forget to call the draw() method after each change.
    my_graph.draw();

Changes the line color

![static-linechart2](/assets/images/static-linechart2.jpg)

Now let's recreate the same graph but using dynamic data instead.

    //Gets the container div element
    const element = document.querrySelector("#my-graph");

    //Creates and customize the graph object
    const my_graph = graph2D(element);

    my_graph.axisDomain({
      x : {start : -8, end : 8},
      y : {start : -1.2, end : 1.2}
    })
    .containerSize({width : 800,  height : 300})
    .pointerMove();

    //Creates the linechart and adds the data
    const line_chart = my_graph.addDataset("linechart");

    line_chart.dataX((dataset, graph)=>{
      //This function will run on every draw
      //Inside this function, dataset makes reference to line_chart and 
      //graph to my_graph

      const domain = graph.axisDomain(); 

      //The return value must be an array of numbers
      return linspace(domain.x.start, domain.x.end, 150)
    })
    .dataY( dataset=>{
      //In this case we only need a reference to the dataset

      const x_values = dataset.dataX(); //From here we can get the generated x values and other non dynamic properties.

      const y = x_values.map(x=>Math.cos(x));

      //Again, the return value must be an array of numbers
      return y;
    });

    //Finally draws the graph
    my_graph.draw();

    

Result:

![dynamic-linechart1](/assets/gifs/dynamic-linechart1.gif)

As shown, the graph can be moved indefinitely and the data moves along with it.

> Warning: You may only read static properties from dynamic data generators, this is because dynamic properties depend on the `x` and `y` data values, so calling those from a data gnerator will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `dataX()` or `draw()` method from the `x` data generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: You must not call the `dataY()` or `draw()` method from the `y` data generator because that will create a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Note: It is safe to call the `dataX()` method from within the `y` data generator and vice versa.

The creation of dynamic properties is slightly different. This is because the properties are assigned to each datapoint so the generator function depends directly on the `x` and `y` data components.

The generator function will be call once for each datapoint and must return a suitable value for that datapoint.

The generator can accept some optional parameters that must be call in the next order:

    generator(x, y, index, arrayX, arrayY, dataset, graph)

*Where:*

* `x`: is the `x` value of the datapoint.
* `y`: is the `y` value of the datapoint.
* `index`: is the index corresponding to the `x` and `y` values.
* `arrayX`: is the complete arary of `x` data values.
* `arrayY`: is the complete arary of `y` data values.
* `dataset`: is a reference to the dataset from which the function is call upon.
* `graph`: is a reference of the graph that the dataset is bound to.

> Note: All the arguments of the property generator function are optional.

> Note: The property generator operates in a similar way of the array methods (map, forEach, etc).

For example, the line color of the last graph can be dynamically change to be dependent of the `y` values by adding:
    
    //Create a colormap
    const color = colorMap({
      from : -1,
      to : 1,
      type : "magnet"
    });

    line_chart.lineColor((x, y)=>{
      //In this case we only need access to the data values in the arguments.
      
      //The return value will be assigned to the corresponding datapoint
      return color(y);
    });

    my_graph.draw();

## ID:

This method lets you get or set the id string of the dataset.

*Method:*

    id()
    id(option)
    id(option, callback)

*Where:*

* `option`: is a string representing the `id` of the dataset.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the `id` is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the dataset object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: The `id` is used to identify the dataset, so the string must be unique among other datasets.

By default, the `id` is generated automatically to guarantee its uniqueness, so in the majority of cases it is best to leave it as it is.

*Returns:*

* A string representing the `id` of the dataset.
* A reference to the dataset object from which the method is called upon.

___

## Index:

This method lets you get or set the index of the dataset.

The index is used to determine the order in which the datasets will be drawn.
The dataset with the lower index value will be drawn first and appear to be behind the other datasets.

*Method:*

    index()
    index(option)
    index(option, callback)

*Where:*

* `option`: is a number representing the `index` value of the dataset.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the `id` is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the dataset object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: The draw order of datasets with the same `index` value will be indeterminate.

*Returns:*

* A number that represents the `index` of the dataset.
* A reference to the dataset object from which the method is called upon.

___

## Line Data

The data in the `linechart` is composed of two arrays of numbers with equal length. Each pair of numbers that share the same index in the arrays represent the `[x, y]` coordinates of one data point.

Each array must be defined independently.

___

### Data x:

This method lets you get ot set the `x` component of the data points.

*Method:*

    dataX()
    dataX(data)
    dataX(data, callback)

*Where:*

* `data` represents the `x` component of the data points. It can be one of the following options:
  * An array of numbers.
  * A function that returns an array of numbers. This function can accept two optional parameters in the following order:
    * An object that represents the dataset from which the method is called upon.
    * An object that represents the graph object that the dataset is bound to.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the data is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the dataset object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: Unlike the callback, If you define the data as a function, that function will be executed on each subsequent draw and the arguments will hold the latest state of the dataset and graph at the moment of the call. 

> Warning: Neither `dataX()` nor `draw()` should be called from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: Any dynamic property should not be read from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Note: It is safe to call static properties.

When the data is defined as a function, we say that is dynamically generated.

If the data is dynamically generated, its values are updated on each draw. It is important to note that the `draw()` method only updates the graph if a change is made to it or any of its assets, so if you change an external value, even if that value is used inside the data function, it will not be detected and the data will not update.

*Returns:*

* An array of numbers representing the `x` component of the datapoints if no arguments are pass.
* A reference to the dataset object from which the method is called upon.

> Note: Even when the data is defined as a function, this method will return an array of numbers.

___

### Data y:

This method lets you get ot set the `y` component of the data points.

*Method:*

    dataY()
    dataY(data)
    dataY(data, callback)

*Where:*

* `data` represents the `y` component of the data points. It can be one of the following options:
  * An array of numbers.
  * A function that returns an array of numbers. This function can accept two optional parameters in the following order:
    * An object that represents the dataset from which the method is called upon.
    * An object that represents the graph object that the dataset is bound to.
* `callback` is a function that is run after the data is set but before the next render, this callback accept two optional arguments that represents the dataset object from which the method is called upon and the graph object that is bound to, in that order.

> Note: Unlike the callback, If you define the data as a function, that function will be executed on each subsequent draw and the arguments will hold the latest state of the dataset and graph at the moment of the call. 

> Warning: Neither `dataY()` nor `draw()` should be called from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Warning: Any dynamic property should not be read from within the data function, because that will cause a circular dependency and the program will stop.

> Note: It is safe to call static properties.
